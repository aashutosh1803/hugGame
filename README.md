# Huggs se Hugss Tak 🧸💩

A goofy, interactive card grid game built with React!

- **25 Cards**: One winner, 24 losers.
- **Goofy Theme**: Mustard yellow, Comic Sans-ish fonts, and wobbling animations.
- **Funny Descriptions**: "Shit" cards give you hilarious life advice like *"Hope, but brown"* or *"The digestive system rage-quitting"*.

  - 👏 **Applause**: When you find the Hugs!
